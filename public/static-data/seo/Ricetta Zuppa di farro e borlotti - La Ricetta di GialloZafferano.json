After this time, open the pot, making sure the pressure has released, and check if the beans are tender. Take about one-third of the borlotti beans into a bowl and strain the rest through a colander. Keep the cooking broth aside for the spelt. Pour the borlotti beans and vegetables into a mixer and blend until pureed. Keep the puree warm."

Add three ladles of the vegetable cooking broth and cook, adding one ladle of broth at a time, for the time indicated on the package (about 15-18 minutes). At the end of cooking, add the borlotti and vegetable puree and mix well, adding a little more broth if it becomes too thick. Finally, add the whole beans you set aside earlier. Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil to taste."
