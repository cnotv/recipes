# Netlify redirects file for Vue.js SPA
# This ensures that all routes are handled by Vue Router
# instead of trying to find physical files on the server

# Redirect all non-file requests to index.html
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Redirect common API endpoints or static assets
# /api/*  https://your-api-domain.com/api/:splat  200
